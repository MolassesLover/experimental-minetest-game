This is a fork of of the 
[MineClone2](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Wuzzy/mineclone2/)
project that aims to use its technical features, but no longer replicate
Minecraft. I have a lot of problems with the game design of Minecraft,
especially when it comes to its progression. This project is my way of
experimenting with radically different ideas that would never make it into
vanilla Minecraft, but could fix a lot of the problems the game has.
